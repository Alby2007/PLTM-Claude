# Discovered Patterns - PLTM 2.0 Autonomy Run

## Meta-Learning Patterns (from recursive self-improvement)

| Target Metric | Average Gain |
|---------------|--------------|
| throughput | 24% |
| precision | 20% |
| insight_quality | 32% |
| information_preservation | 28% |
| learning_rate | 40% |

## Improvement Hypotheses Applied

1. **Process multiple queries simultaneously** - Parallel processing
2. **Weight retrieval by relevance** - Attention mechanism
3. **Prioritize highly-connected knowledge** - Network effects
4. **Hold contradictions in superposition** - Quantum-inspired memory
5. **Find patterns in improvement patterns** - Meta-meta-learning

## Architecture Patterns

### 2026 AGI Architecture Pattern
```
Layer 1: Self-Referential Core
├─ Gradient-guided exploration (learn how to learn)
├─ Recursive context management (manage own state)
└─ Meta-optimization (optimize own optimization)

Layer 2: Critical Point Operation
├─ Self-Organized Criticality (maintain at edge of chaos)
├─ Information-Entropy equilibrium (balance order/disorder)
└─ Phase transition awareness (recognize emergence points)

Layer 3: Compositional Intelligence
├─ Modular skills with standard interfaces (MCP)
├─ Semantic composition (ToolWeaver-style)
└─ Hierarchical decomposition (zero-shot RL)

Layer 4: Evaluation-Aware Learning
├─ Optimize for measurability (EvA-RL)
├─ Multi-metric awareness (avoid metric artifacts)
└─ Continuous assessment (reliable self-evaluation)
```

## Universal Principles Implemented

1. **Fixed-Point Convergence** (Nash equilibrium) - Conflict resolution
2. **Parallel Processing** (Superposition) - Quantum memory
3. **Selective Amplification** (Attention) - Weighted retrieval
4. **Network Effects** (Connectivity) - Knowledge graph
5. **Critical Point Operation** (Edge of chaos) - Criticality monitoring
